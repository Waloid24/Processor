# Processor
Hello everyone! Here the similarity of the real work of the processor and assembler is implemented. To copy the files related to the assembly language, type in the command line:
```
make asm
```
to the processor operation:
```
make cpu
```
To start the assembler, type:
```
./asm.out quadrat.txt quadrat.bin
```
where the first argument is the name of the file with the code, and the second argument is the name of the file where the converted code goes.

To solve the quadratic equation, type in the command 
line:
```
./cpu.out quadrat.bin
```
where the first argument is the name of the file with the converted code.

Or you can write your own program and run it :)
