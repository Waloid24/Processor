# Processor
Hello everyone! Here the similarity of the real work of the processor and assembler is implemented. To solve the quadratic equation, type in the command 
line:
```
./a.out quadrat.txt asm.bin
```
To calculate the factorial of a number, enter:
```
./a.out factorial.txt asm.bin
```
Or you can write your own program and run it :)
